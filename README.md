## Objectives

1. Import and explore structured startup funding data.
2. Solve real-world business problems using SQL.
3. Analyze investment behavior of individual sharks.
4. Generate investor-focused metrics like ROI and deal diversity.
5. Deliver actionable insights to help optimize funding and marketing decisions.

## Business Tasks & SQL Solutions

---

### üß† Task 1: Promote Season 4 by showcasing the highest funding domain-wise.

```sql
select Industry , max(Total_Deal_Amount_in_lakhs) as 'highest funding' from sharktank
group by Industry;
```

---

### üß† Task 2: Identify domains where female-to-male pitcher ratio >70%.

```sql
select*,(female/male)*100 as 'pitcher_ratio' from
(
	select Industry , sum(Female_Presenters) as 'female',
	sum(Male_Presenters) as 'male' from sharktank
	group by Industry
	having sum(Male_Presenters) > 0 and sum(Female_Presenters) > 0
) k
where (female/male)*100  > 70 ;
```

---

### üß† Task 3: Show volume of pitches, offers, conversions per season.

```sql
select  a.Season_Number, total, received_offer_total, (received_offer_total/total)*100 as 'received %',
accepted_offer_total , (accepted_offer_total / total) * 100 as 'accepted %'from(
	select Season_Number,count(Startup_Name) as 'total' from
	sharktank group by Season_Number
) a
inner join
(
	select Season_Number,count(Startup_Name) as 'received_offer_total' from sharktank
	where Received_Offer = 'Yes' group by Season_Number
) b
on a.Season_Number = b.Season_Number
inner join(
	select Season_Number,count(Startup_Name) as 'accepted_offer_total' from sharktank
	where Accepted_Offer = 'Yes' group by Season_Number
) c
on b.Season_Number = c.Season_Number;
```

---

### üß† Task 4: Find the season with the highest average monthly sales and top 5 industries.

```sql
set @highest_avg_m_sales_season = (select Season_Number from(
	select Season_Number , Round(avg(Monthly_Sales_in_lakhs),2) as 'avg_mon_sales_by_season' from
	sharktank group by Season_Number
	order by Round(avg(Monthly_Sales_in_lakhs),2) desc limit 1
) m );

select Industry , Round(avg(Monthly_Sales_in_lakhs),2) as 'avg_mon_sales'
from sharktank
where Season_Number = @highest_avg_m_sales_season
group by Industrygenre_preferences
order by Round(avg(Monthly_Sales_in_lakhs),2)  desc limit 5;
```

---

### üß† Task 5: Identify industries with consistent funding growth across all seasons.

```sql
WITH ValidIndustries AS (
    SELECT 
        industry, 
        MAX(CASE WHEN season_number = 1 THEN total_deal_amount_in_lakhs END) AS season_1,
        MAX(CASE WHEN season_number = 2 THEN total_deal_amount_in_lakhs END) AS season_2,
        MAX(CASE WHEN season_number = 3 THEN total_deal_amount_in_lakhs END) AS season_3
    FROM sharktank 
    GROUP BY industry 
    HAVING season_3 > season_2 AND season_2 > season_1 AND season_1 != 0
)  

SELECT 
    t.season_number,
    t.industry,
    COUNT(t.startup_Name) AS Total,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN t.received_offer = 'Yes' THEN t.startup_Name END) AS Received,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN t.accepted_offer = 'Yes' THEN t.startup_Name END) AS Accepted
FROM sharktank AS t
JOIN ValidIndustries AS v ON t.industry = v.industry
GROUP BY t.season_number, t.industry;  
```

### üß† Task 6: Create a system for sharks to calculate ROI time.

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE turn_around_time(IN startup VARCHAR(100))
BEGIN
    DECLARE offer_status VARCHAR(10);
    DECLARE revenue_info VARCHAR(50);

    -- Get the status and revenue
    SELECT Accepted_Offer, Yearly_Revenue_in_lakhs
    INTO offer_status, revenue_info
    FROM sharktank
    WHERE Startup_Name = startup
    LIMIT 1;

    -- Logic to handle different cases
    IF offer_status = 'No' THEN
        SELECT 'Turnaround time cannot be calculated as startup didn‚Äôt accept the offer' AS message;

    ELSEIF revenue_info = 'Not Mentioned' and offer_status = 'Yes'  THEN
        SELECT 'Turnaround time cannot be calculated as past data not available' AS message;

    ELSE
        SELECT 
            Startup_Name,
            Yearly_Revenue_in_lakhs,
            Total_Deal_Amount_in_lakhs,
            Total_Deal_Equity,
            ROUND(
                Total_Deal_Amount_in_lakhs / (Yearly_Revenue_in_lakhs * (Total_Deal_Equity / 100.0)),
                2
            ) AS ROI_Time_in_Years
        FROM sharktank
        WHERE Startup_Name = startup;
    END IF;

END;
//
DELIMITER ;

CALL turn_around_time('BoozScooters');
```

### üß† Task 7: Identify the most generous shark by average deal size.

```sql
select sharkname , avg(investment) as 'average' from
